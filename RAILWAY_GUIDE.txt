GOLDEN KNIGHT CHESS CLUB - RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
===================================================

STEP 1: PREPARE YOUR REPOSITORY
------------------------------
- Make sure your code is pushed to GitHub
- Ensure the Procfile exists (with: web: node server/index.js)
- Check that db-push.js script is included (created in this update)

STEP 2: DEPLOY ON RAILWAY
------------------------
1. Sign up/login at https://railway.app
2. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select your repository
4. Railway will automatically detect your Node.js application

STEP 3: ADD A DATABASE
---------------------
1. In your project, click "New" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
2. Railway will provision a PostgreSQL database
3. The DATABASE_URL env var will be automatically added

STEP 4: CONFIGURE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
-------------------------------------
1. Go to the "Variables" tab
2. Add these variables:
   - NODE_ENV: production
   - JWT_SECRET: (add a secure random string)

STEP 5: INITIALIZE THE DATABASE
-----------------------------
1. After deployment completes, open shell
2. Run: node db-push.js
3. For sample data: node db-push.js --with-sample-data

STEP 6: ACCESS YOUR APPLICATION
-----------------------------
1. Use the URL provided by Railway
2. Login with Admin/1234

KEY CHANGES MADE FOR RAILWAY COMPATIBILITY:
-----------------------------------------
1. Updated server/index.js to detect Railway deployment
2. Added CORS support for Railway domains
3. Created db-push.js for database schema initialization
4. Enhanced WebSocket host detection for Railway

TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------
- Database issues: Check DATABASE_URL and run db-push.js
- Connection problems: Check CORS and WebSocket URL configuration
- Deployment failures: Check build logs in Railway dashboard
